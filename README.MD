This is a mini-project to practice database usage with Node.JS

The database used in this project is MongoDB specifically with the help of Mongoose.

This repo was initially created with an already developed template for a to-do list that was using array's to populate
new items into the list. The goal will be to edit the functionality so that arrays are no longer used to hold the data, as this is 
bad practice as no data persistence is availble in this type of functionality. Once the server is restarted, all to-do items are lost.
